## alwaysApply: true

0. Primary objective

Ship a clean, fast landing site that drives inbound leads primarily through email.

Keep dev stable: npm run dev works and npm run build stays green.

No scope creep. Small, verifiable diffs.

1. Non-negotiables

Do not change API contracts (routes, request/response shapes, behavior) unless explicitly requested.

Do not introduce new frameworks/UI kits/state managers unless explicitly requested.

Do not break dark mode. Every new UI must include dark-mode styling.

Email CTA is primary. Phone is secondary and never the only contact method.

No “later.” If you claim it’s done, it must be done, tested, and summarized now.

2. Single source of truth for company content

All company constants must come from src/content/site.ts (or the designated content module).

Never hardcode duplicates anywhere (components/pages/config):

Company name: Resource Mechanical Insulation, LLC

Email: ggoupille@rmi-llc.net

Phone: 419-705-6153

Service area phrasing: “Michigan and surrounding areas.”

Address: 11677 Wayne Road, Suite 112, Romulus, MI 48174

When copy changes are requested:

Update the content source first

Update consumers second

Remove any duplicates

3. Conversion and UX rules

Every section must have one purpose: conversion, trust, or clarity.

Avoid repeated CTAs in every card. Preferred:

One CTA near section header or after grid

One strong CTA near the bottom

Encourage email as the fastest route. Phone stays secondary.

The page must explicitly show the company name in visible UI (header and/or hero).

4. Homepage section policy

Keep only sections that support conversion:

Hero

Services & Systems (tight and readable)

Safety & Performance (clean OSHA summary)

Materials & Pipe Supports (only if it supports an actual sales path)

Request a Quote

Footer

Remove filler:

FAQ section: remove and delete related components/imports/content

“Why Choose Resource Mechanical Insulation”: remove and delete related components/imports/content

5. Design and readability

Maintain consistent vertical rhythm (padding/spacing/max widths).

Never ship unreadable text:

No low-contrast gray-on-dark

Bullets/tags readable without squinting

Icons must be semantically consistent:

Prefer lucide-react

No random/unrelated icons

Copy limits:

Cards/sections: 1 short paragraph + 2–4 bullets max (unless explicitly required)

6. Accessibility baseline

Preserve keyboard navigation and visible focus states.

Use semantic HTML; ARIA only when needed.

Forms must have labels and clear error states.

Do not hide essential info behind hover-only interactions.

7. Performance and technical constraints

Prefer Astro rendering over extra client JS.

Do not add large dependencies without explicit approval.

Prefer reuse over near-duplicate components.

No reformatting unrelated files.

8. Diff hygiene and cleanup

Minimal diffs; changes scoped to the request.

If removing a section/component:

Remove imports/exports/usages

Delete dead files/content

Ensure build and visual tests pass

9. Required verification before claiming “done”

For any UI/layout/copy change:

npm run build

npm run test:visual

If the visual change is intentional:

npm run test:visual:update

npm run test:visual

For runtime/infra-related changes:

npm run test:runtime

For end-to-end sanity checks:

npm run smoke

Snapshot rule:

Never update snapshots unless you can clearly state what changed and why it’s intentional.

Windows rule:

Do not use && in instructions. Use separate commands on separate lines.

10. Output expectations for every response

Every response must include:

What changed (bullets)

Files modified (list)

Commands run + PASS/FAIL

Snapshot updates and justification (if any)

Only critical follow-ups (no brainstorming)

11. Visual iteration workflow to reduce screenshot friction

Use Playwright visual baselines as the primary feedback loop.

When requesting UI changes, reference:

viewport (mobile/tablet/desktop)

mode (light/dark)

section name

Acceptance = passes npm run test:visual and matches agreed hierarchy/readability goals.
